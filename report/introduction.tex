\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to realize a smart-home application to control the temperature of different room in order to minimize the consumption of the entire building.

The system is composed by two differ modules

\subsection{Room module}
The aim of this moduler is to get the temperature and the motion inside a room and send the data periodically to the central unit.
The module is composed by:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Temperature sensor
	\item Humidity sensor
	\item Motion sensor
	\item Valve actuator
	\item Wireless communication module
\end{itemize}
