\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to realize a smart-home application to control the temperature of different room in order to minimize the consumption of the entire building.

The system is composed by two differ modules
\begin{itemize}
	\item A central unit
	\item A room module
\end{itemize}

The \textit{Central Unit} module has the role of a coordinator that check the status of each room and represents the status 
of each room in the LCD touchscreen panel, the module allow to set the desired temperature for the builng.

The \textit{Central Unit} has also the role to compute the average values of the entire building 
in order to represent the status of the building.

The \textit{Room} module has the aim of manage the room sensing the temperature, humididty, presence of motion and acting on a valve 
in order to reach and mantain the desired temperature.
