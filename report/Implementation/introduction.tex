\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to realize a smart-home application to control the heating system of a building based on the temperature of each room, in order to minimize the consumption of the building each room apply an energy saving function reducing the desired temperature when it is not needed.
The system is composed by two differ modules
\begin{itemize}
	\item central unit module 
	\item room module
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Central Unit}
The \textit{Central Unit} has the role of coordinator that retrieve the status of each room and computes the average values for the building.\\

\subsubsection{Graphical user interface}
Using a graphical User Interface the module represents the average values of the building and the values for each room, the graphical User Interface is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Main page} to represent the overview of the building
	\item \textit{Room page} to represent the status of each room
	\item \textit{Settings page} to set the desired temperature
\end{itemize}

Whenever the \textit{Main page} is selected the module shall represent the average values among all the rooms for \textit{Temperature}, \textit{Humidity} and \textit{Usage}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Main page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Energy Saving} if at least one room is set to \textit{Energy Saving mode}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Main page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Warning} if at least one room is set to \textit{crashed}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Main page} is selected the module shall allow the user to move in the \textit{Settings page}, next and previous \textit{Room page}.\\

Whenever the \textit{Settings page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Desired Temperature} and shall allow the user to increase or deacrease it by a factor of 0.5 C\degree in the range of 15 C\degree and 30 C\degree.\\
Whenever the \textit{Settings page} is selected the module shall represent the average values among all the rooms for \textit{Humidity} and \textit{Usage}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Settings page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Energy Saving} if at least one room is set to \textit{Energy Saving mode}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Settings page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Warning} if at least one room is set to \textit{crashed}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Settings page} is selected the module shall allow the user to move in the \textit{Main page}.\\

Whenever the \textit{Room page} is selected the module shall represent the average values among all the rooms for \textit{Temperature}, \textit{Humidity} and \textit{Usage}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Room page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Energy Saving} if at least one room is set to \textit{Energy Saving mode}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Room page} is selected the module shall represent the \textit{Warning} if at least one room is set to \textit{crashed}.\\
Whenever the \textit{Room page} is selected the module shall allow the user to move in the \textit{Main page}, \textit{Settings page}, next and previous \textit{Room page}.\\

The graphical user interface shall represent the following information as reported in the table \ref{tab:GraphicalInformations}.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
			\begin{tabular}{||l | l||} 
			\hline
			\textbf{Information}	& \textbf{Format} \\ 
			\hline
			Temperature	& C\degree \\ 
			\hline
			Humidity	& \% \\ 
			\hline
			Usage		& \% \\ 
			\hline
			Energy Saving	& boolean \\ 
			\hline
			Warning		& boolean \\ 
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\captionof{table}{Display Information\label{tab:GraphicalInformations}}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Communication}
Whenever a \textit{Room Request message} is sent and the \textit{Room Status message} is not received within 40s the module shall mark the room as \textbf{crashed}.
The module shall send the \textit{Room Request message} for each initialized room at least every 160s.

%--------------------------------------
\subsection{Room Module}
The purpose of this module is to control the temperature of the room acting on a valve in order to 
reach and maintain the \textit{GoalTemperature}.

\subsubsection{Energy Saving mode}
In order to minimize the consumption the module keep tracks of the presence of motion inside the room
using a motion sensor. \\

If at least one motion is detected in the last 30s, the module shall set the \textit{GoalTemperature} to the one set by the user, otherwise the module shall set the \textit{GoalTemperature} to:

\begin{equation}
	GoalTemperature = DesiredTemperature - EnergySavingTemperatureOffset
\end{equation}
Whenever the module is in \textit{Energy Saving mode} it shall notify it through the \textit{Interface}.

\subsubsection{Valve control}
In order to control the heating of the room the valve is moved to different positions based on the temperature error 
(\textit{ActualTemperature} - \textit{GoalThemperature}) as in the following table, 
whenever one of these rules is valid the module shall move the valve in the correspondent position described in the third column of the table \ref{tab:ValvePositions} as percentage of maximum flow.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |} 
		\hline
		\textbf{rule} & \textbf{valve position} & \textbf{Flow in \%}\\
		\hline
		\begin{math} error < -HIGH \end{math} &  OPEN\_POSITION & 100\\
		\hline
		\begin{math} error \in [-HIGH, -APPROCHING) \end{math}  & HIGH\_POSITION & 75\\
		\hline
		\begin{math} error \in [-APPROCHING, +APPROCHING] \end{math} & MIDDLE\_POSITION & 50 \\
		\hline
		\begin{math} error \in (APPROCHING, HIGH] \end{math} & LOW\_POSITION & 25\\
		\hline
		error > HIGH &  CLOSED\_POSITION & 0 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}{\label{tab:ValvePositions}}
\end{center}
Whenever the valve is in \textit{OPEN\_POSITION} or \textit{CLOSED\_POSITION} the module shall check the position and set the \textbf{Valve Error} if it is not valid.

In the following table\ref{tab:TemperatureThresholds} are reported the temperature thresholds:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{||l | l||} 
		\hline
		HIGH 		& 2 C\degree \\ 
		\hline
		APPROCHING 	& 1 C\degree \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}{\label{tab:TemperatureThresholds}}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Communication}
Whenever a \textit{Room Request message} is not received within 60s the module shall send the \textit{Room Status Message} and set the \textbf{Communication error}.

\subsubsection{Errors}
Whenever one of the errors are set, the module shall notify it through the \textit{Interface}.
In the following table \ref{tab:RoomErrors} are reported the possible errors.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|| l ||} 
		\hline
		\textbf{Valve error} \\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{Communication error} \\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{Sensor error} \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}{\label{tab:RoomErrors}}
\end{center}
