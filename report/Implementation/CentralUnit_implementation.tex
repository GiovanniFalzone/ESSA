\end{figure}

The module is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item STM32F407VG DISCOVERY powered by ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit
	\item LCD board Touchscreen 3‚Äù5
\end{itemize}
In the discovery board are running the \textit{Central Unit's} tasks on top of Erika RTOS, the system is composed by three different tasks reported in the table \ref{tab:CU_Tasks}.\\
Whenever a \textit{Room Status} message arrives through the \textit{USART} interface, the \textit{Check message} aperiodic task is activated in order to check the message and execute the \textit{Room's} functionalities.\\
The \textit{Check  message} task apply a simple JSON compliance test and check each field name and value of the message, then the message is converted in a \textit{Room structure} and the Room's status and \textit{Building} status are updated.\\
While the \textit{Check message} task has the role of processing the incoming \textit{Room Status}, the \textit{Polling} task has the role of managing the rooms sending a check message periodically one room after the other, 
if the response \textit{Room Status} message doesn't arrive within the next task's job it's considered as an error and the same \textit{Room Request} message is sent until a maximum of 3 resend, then the room is marked as crashed.\\
The \textit{Graphic} task has the role to represent the data of the building and for each room depending on the selected page by the user, in the settings page the user is able to set the desired temperature that will be sent starting from the next job of the \textit{Polling} task.\\

The module is using the \textit{USART6} of the discovery board to communicate with the \textit{room} modules, in the following table is reported \textbf{USART}'s configuration.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c | c | c | c ||} 
		\hline
		USART 	& TX pin 	& RX pin	& baud-rate & Parity Bit & Stop bits & Control Flow \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}{USART configuration \label{tab:USARTConfiguration}}
\end{center}

\subsection{Graphic Interface}
The graphic interface is compose by three different screens:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Home screen
	\item Settings screen
	\item Room screen
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth} % width of left subfigure
		\includegraphics[width=4cm,keepaspectratio]{img/home_screen}
		\caption{Home screen}
		\label{fig:home_screen}
		\end{subfigure}
	\vspace{1em} % here you can insert horizontal or vertical space
	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth} % width of right subfigure
		\includegraphics[width=4cm,keepaspectratio]{img/settings_screen}
		\caption{Settings screen}
		\label{fig:settings_screen}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth} % width of right subfigure
		\includegraphics[width=4cm,keepaspectratio]{img/room_screen}
		\caption{Room screen}
		\label{fig:room_screen}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
The main page is the \textbf{home screen} reported in \ref{fig:home_screen}, in this page are reported the average values of the building,
If at least one room is marked as \textit{crashed} then a warning appear on the home screen.
If at least one room is in \textit{eco mode} then an \textit{eco} icon is displayed on the home screen.
If the difference between the desired temperature and the actual average temperature is less then 0.5C\degree, the shown thermometer icon is hot otherwise cold.
In the \textbf{settings screen} reported in \ref{fig:settings_screen} it is possible to set the desired temperature of the building that is the same for each room.
In the \textbf{room screen} reported in \ref{fig:room_screen} is displayed the status of the selected room, status composed by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eco mode (the icon on the top-left of the screen)
	\item Temperature
	\item Humidity
	\item Valve position
	\item Warning (Warning icon between the eco icon and the icon in the top-center)
\end{itemize}
