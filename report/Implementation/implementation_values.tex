\section{JSON messages implementation}
As described in the SySML internal model of the system \ref{fig:CentralUnit_internals}, the modules exchange information as \textit{Room request} and \textit{Room status}.
These messages have been implemented using the \textit{JSON} format, in the following are reported two messages exchanged during execution.
In the following version of the project the field names and the order of the variables must follow this example otherwise the simple JSON parser will consider the message as corrupted.

\subsection{Request Message}
\lstset{style=custompython}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
	{
		"Id":"01",
		"DTemp":"30.00"
	}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Status Message}
\lstset{style=custompython}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
{
	"Id":"02","Eco":"0",
	"sens":[
		{"Nm":"Tmp","Val":"23.70","Fmt":"C"},
		{"Nm":"Hum","Val":"051.90","Fmt":"\%"}
	],
	"acts":[
		{"Nm":"Vlv","Val":"100","Fmt":"\%"}
	]
}
\end{lstlisting}
