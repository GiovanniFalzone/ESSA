\section{Future Work}
This kind of \textbf{energy saving} application strictly depends on the usage of the building and the building itself.\\
In order to maximize the effectiviness of the heating system and minimize the consumption, different prameters play an important role, I report some of them in the following list
\begin{itemize}
	\item room characteristicts (dimension, orientation, furnitures, etc.)
	\item usage of the room strictly depends on the users' life style
	\item external weather condition
	\item period of the year
\end{itemize}
These parameters have to be taken in consideration to compute the \textbf{energy threshold} of each room in such a way that the single room can reach the desired temperature in the shortest time.

One of the possible future work could be to integrate a \textit{Machine Learning} functionality in order to adjust this \textit{energy threshold} parameter considering all the informations related to the construction of the building and the usage coming from the sensors in the rooms.
